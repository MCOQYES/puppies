        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>Hi Uuree,<br>
        I made this small space for us — simple, quiet, and honest.<br>
        We come from opposite sides of the world: you from Mongolia, me from Colombia.<br>
        And somehow, our paths crossed in Madrid.</p>

        <h2>What I Feel for You</h2>
        <p>You feel close, even from far away.<br>
        Your presence softens my days.<br>
        Your words stay with me longer than you know.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What I Dream With You</h2>
        <p>I dream of simple things: walking beside you, sharing a meal, hearing your laugh without a screen in between.<br>
        I want to learn your world — and show you mine.</p>

        <h2>Where Our Worlds Meet</h2>
        <img src="assets/photo.jpg" alt="Us together" class="main-photo">
        <p>Between Mongolia and Colombia, there are thousands of kilometers.<br>
        But all those lines on the map bend toward one point: Madrid.</p>

        <h2>Our Future</h2>
        <p>I don’t know what the future looks like.<br>
        But I know what I want: a future where you’re part of my days, not just my messages.</p>

        <h2>Midpoint</h2>
        <p>
        Between your sky and mine,<br>
        there is a line the world cannot see.<br><br>

        It crosses oceans,<br>
        mountains,<br>
        time zones,<br>
        and still finds its way<br>
        to a single place.<br><br>

        A midpoint.<br>
        A city.<br>
        A moment.<br>
        You and me.<br><br>

        Two distant worlds,<br>
        quietly choosing<br>
        the same direction.
